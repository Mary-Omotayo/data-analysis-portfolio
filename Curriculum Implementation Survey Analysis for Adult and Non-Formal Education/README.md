Curriculum Implementation Survey Analysis for Adult and Non-Formal Education
This project involves the analysis of field research data collected across six geo-political zones in Nigeria to evaluate the extent of curriculum implementation in Adult and Non-Formal Education (ANFE) centres. The project was executed using KoboToolbox for data collection, and SPSS and Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.

üìå Project Objectives
Identify the types of curricula being used in ANFE centres.

Assess curriculum effectiveness and compatibility with learners' developmental needs.

Evaluate facilitators‚Äô teaching approaches and learning outcomes.

Provide data-driven insights to inform future curriculum improvement and policy decisions.

üîç Key Insights
57% of centres use approved ANFE curricula, while 19% use formal education curricula.

Most curricula meet standards for clarity, appropriateness, and developmental relevance.

Correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between facilitators‚Äô teaching methods and learners‚Äô outcomes. Results indicated positive associations with learners‚Äô interest, self-expression, and cognitive skill development.

Use of information technology is limited at the basic literacy level but emerging at post-literacy.

Learners showed increased interest and skill development, especially in critical and creative thinking.


‚úÖ Use Cases
Policy evaluation and education program improvement

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) for education interventions

Curriculum development and adaptation

üß† Author‚Äôs Note
This analysis contributes to understanding the actual implementation of adult education curricula in Nigeria and provides evidence for better instructional and policy decisions. It reflects my ability to manage data from field to insight, using a blend of modern tools and practical research approaches.
