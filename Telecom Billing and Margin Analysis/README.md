# Telecom Billing & Margin Analysis

Overview: This project involves analyzing telecom billing data to calculate total billing amounts, gross margins, and other key metrics. It uses Excel to process billing information from different clients and vendors, with calculations based on rates for landline and mobile calls. The analysis also includes comparisons of gross margins by country, carrier, and client.
## âœ… Objectives

- Calculate total client billing based on per-minute rules
- Calculate vendor costs considering individual billing increments
- Compute gross margins per client, carrier, number, and country
- Test the impact of increasing mobile and landline rates by set percentages
- Recommend changes needed to reach a 45% overall gross margin

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
  - Advanced Formulas (ROUNDUP, SUMIFS, LOOKUPs)
  - Pivot Tables
  - Scenario Analysis
  - Data Validation for rate changes

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Gross margin was most sensitive to vendor rate increments and call distribution by type (mobile vs. landline).
- Vendor billing methods significantly impact profitability â€” per-second and 6-second billing yielded lower costs.
- A configurable version of the sheet was created to test rate changes and margin impacts.

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Re-negotiate rates with vendors using minute-based billing
- Monitor high-cost routes and client usage trends
- Implement automation to update margins when rate changes occur

## ðŸ’¼ Outcome

Successfully presented the findings in a structured report and interactive Excel dashboard.
